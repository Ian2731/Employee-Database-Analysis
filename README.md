I have designed tables to hold data in CSVs and have the ability to perform:

-Data Modeling

-Data Engineering
  -Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files

-Data Analysis:
  
  -List details of each employee: 
    (employee number)
    (last name)
    (first name)
    (gender)
    (salary)
